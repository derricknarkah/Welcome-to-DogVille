# Welcome-to-DogVille
This is my second project as part of a Nanodegree program in Data Analytics offered by ALX-T. This project will take you into the world of DogVille. Dive into it now.

The project seeks to help students understand Data Gathering, Assessing and Cleaning.

With the twitter API, information about tweets from the twitter user @dog_rates are extracted and combined with a dataset containing tweet, rating of dogs, stage of dogs among others.
The data is assessed and cleaned to make it suitable for a plot.
